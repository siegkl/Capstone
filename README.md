 Delaware Tech, CT Department Wilmington
Project #0: Textbook History (FY17 CSC SLOA Project)
I. Introduction:
The Computer Science Department of XYZ University has been using ACCESS database to keep track of the textbooks that the department has adopted since 2005. However, this application can only be run within the school network. Your job is to develop a web application to replace the existing one.
II. General Specification:
1) Application Components:
Graphical User Interface (GUI) front end and Database backend are required.
2) Programming Tools:
i. For client side: you may use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and C# related
visual tool. For Java, you must use JavaFX with Scene Builder.
ii. For server side: you may use PhP, C#-related MS product, NodeJS or
Java.
iii. For Databases: you may use any available DBMS so long as it resides on
the server side.
iv. You are encouraged to use the free Amazon Web Services (AWS).
3) Data Base Fields:
i. Semester: in the format of YYYY{51, 52, 53}; 51 means Fall, 52 is Spring,
and 53 is Summer. Example, 201751 is the fall semester of 2017 academic year. (Note, this is actually the fall semester of 2016 since 2017 academic year runs from fall of 2016 to the end of summer of 2017.)
ii. Course Number: in the format of XXXDDD. Example: CSC214.
iii. Course Title: 30 characters at most.
iv. Book’s ISBN number: 13 alphanumeric.
v. Book’s Title: 50 characters at most.
vi. Course Lead: 3-character initial of the faculty member who adopted the
book.
vii. Course Lead Name: 25 Charters at most.
viii. Notes: variable length or 50 characters at most.
4) Tables: You will need more than one tables so that data redundancy can be minimized.
III. Human Interface Specification:
1) Provide the following functions
i. Query: May use Course Number and/or Semester or Course Lead to
retrieve information.
ii. Add/Edit: Require login.
iii. Save/Print the query result. (Note: No login required.)
2) Use appropriate GUI controls to minimize the keyboard input by the user.
3) Use the Web Page design principles that you have learned to make your web site
attractive.
IV. Assignment:
1) Part A (for GEAT)
i. Form a group of 4.
ii. Design the overall user interface and Data Base by all members.
iii. Design the test strategy by all members.
iv. Assign job functions (2 Coding, 1 testing, and 1 reporting.)
2) Part B (for GenED): Summarize your product according to the following:
i. Hardware Components;
ii. Software Components;
iii. Network Components;
iv. Development tools that you used;
v. Programming Languages that you used;
vi. Data Structures that you have used.
V. Schedules:
1) 2/16/2017:
2) 3/9/2017:
3) 3/30/2017:
4) 4/20/2017:
Submit group list and the nomination of the group leader. Submit the interface and database design.
Submit the revised design and first test run with instructor. Final test run with the instructor and submit the projects with
documentation and the description of works completed by each individual. 5) 4/25/2017: Class presentation.
